### Full Stack Open

This repository contains the exercises and notes for the Full Stack Open course. The course is offered by the University of Helsinki and is completely free. The course covers React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.

I use this course to quickly pick up knowledge and explore on technologies mentioned above. I am aiming to finish all the exercises in this course.
